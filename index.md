<h1><u>American Football</u></h1>
<hr>
<h2>How it Started</h2>
<p1>American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of soccer and rugby. <br>
The first American football match was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams, 
<br>
Rutgers and Princeton, using rules based on the rules of soccer at the time.</p1>

<h2>Who Started It?</h2>

<p1> Walter Camp is considered the 'founder' of American football. Camp was a great rugby player from <br>
Yale University who began to transform rules of rugby for a more 'modern' style of play, which <br>
eventually developed into the sport of football during the 1880's. As a Yale undergraduate and <br>
medical student from 1876 to 1881, Camp played halfback and served as team captain, equivalent <br>
to head coach at the time. Even more importantly, he was the guiding force on the rules board of<br>
 the newly formed Intercollegiate Football Association.</p1>
